# Lesson 1: HTML, Attributes, Inline, and Block Elements

In this challenge, we're going to be adding basic HTML elements and styling them. Start with the `index.html` file and add the tags within the `<body></body>` tag.

### Requirements

- Edit the `<title></title>` metatag in the header and add a title with your name on it.
- Use the following block element tags correctly on the page within the body in this order: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>` with 3 list items, `<h2>`, `<ol>` with 3 list items, `<p>`, `<div>`. 
- Within the `<h1>` element, type your full name.
- For the _first_ `<p>` tag after the `<h1>`, insert an image of yourself or use the provided sample image from `/img`.
- An example image can pulled from the `/img/` directory, or if you'd like to add your own then download it and add to the `/img/` directory. If you'd like you can use your own. 
- For the _second_ `<p>`, introduce yourself & insert 3 sentences about you.
- For the _first_ `<h2>` tag, type `Strengths`.
- For the `<ul>`, add 3 or more `<li>` with strengths that you would list on a resume.
- For the _second_ `<h2>` tag, type `Experience`.
- For the `<ol>`, add 3 or more `<li>` coding languages you've had experience with.
- For the _third_ `<p>` add a fun fact about yourself.
- In the last `<div>`, add whatever content you'd like. Some ideas: links to social media, contact information, etc.
- Use the following inline element tags correctly anywhere on the page at least once: `<a>`, `<br>`, `<em>`, `<address>`, `<strong>`, `<img>`.
- At the end, run your code through the HTML Validator and **fix any errors** you notice.
- **EXTRA:** Determine labels for each of your sections and use the provided comment template `<!-- ELEMENT TAG -->` & `<!--// ENDS: ELEMENT TAG -->` to comment out individual sections of your HTML.
- **EXTRA:** Add properties to tags you've used (`alt=""`, `class=""`, etc.) or use an element that was not required in this lesson, _only_ if you have extra time. Refer to the HTML Element Reference for ones to use.

### Key Concepts

- **Block elements:** HTML elements that create a "block" in the display by appearing on their own line.
- **Tags(element):** HTML annotations which indicate how the text should be formatted.
- **P tag:** An HTML tag that indicates text should be formatted in a paragraph.
- **Opening tag:** An HTML tag that appears before the text that will be formatted in an HTML document. For example, the `<p> in <p> This is a paragraph. </p>` is the opening tag.
- **Closing tag:** An HTML tag that appears after the text that is formatted. It matches the opening tag but begins with a /. For example, the `</p>` in `<p> This is a paragraph. </p>` is the closing tag.
- **End tag:** An alternative name for a closing tag.
- **Header:** An HTML tag to indicate the text being formatted is a header. There are 6 sizes of HTML headers `<h1> through <h6>`.
- **Whitespace:** All of the "empty" space that includes spaces, indentation, blank lines, etc.
- **Unordered list:** A list of items that are designated with bullet points.
- **Ordered list:** A list of items designated with numbers.
- **List item:** An item in an ordered or unordered list.
- I**nline element:** HTML elements that do not appear on their own line, but instead share a line with other elements.
- **Attribute:** Additional information provided to an HTML tag. For instance, the href attribute in an `<a>` tag provides the URL a link should travel to.
- **Relative path:** A path to a file within the project itself. Usually referring to the location provided in as the href attribute in an <a> tag.
- **Self-closing:** An HTML element that does not require a closing tag, such as `<img>`.
